# NodeJS Backend Fundamentals — Notes, Experiments & Internals

This repository documents my understanding, experiments, and research while learning backend development and NodeJS internals.  
The goal is to go beyond writing Node applications and instead explore **how the platform actually works behind the scenes** — covering architecture, execution flow, performance behavior, and scalable backend patterns.
